        If you go to some <span></span> place like Yellowstone National <span></span>, you must know how to deal with the wild animals such as bears and wolves and <span></span>. The most important of these is the bear. There are three kinds of bears, the grizzly bear, the <span></span> bear, and the <span></span> bear. Bears spend most of their time <span></span> or <span></span>. They look very <span></span>, but if you make them <span></span>, they might bite your <span></span>. Bears will come up to your car and beg for <span></span>. They will stand on their hind legs and clap their <span></span> together and pretend to be <span></span>. But do not get out of your <span></span> or offer the bears <span></span> or <span></span>. This same advice applies to other wild creatures such as <span></span> and <span></span>. Remember all these rules and you will spend your vacation <span></span> and not get eaten by a/an <span></span>.

      <p id="bookText" class="hidden">
        There are many <span></span> ways to choose a/an <span></span> to read. First, you could ask for recommendations from your friends and <span></span>. Just don't ask Aunt <span></span>&#8212;she only reads <span></span> books with <span></span>-ripping goddesses on the cover. If your friends and family are no help, try checking out the <span></span> review in <em>The <span></span> Times</em>. If the <span></span> featured there are too <span></span> for your taste, try something a little more low-<span></span>, like <em><span></span>: The <span></span> Magazine</em>, or <em><span></span> Magazine</em>. You could also choose a book the <span></span>-fashioned way. Head to your local library or <span></span> and browse the shelves until something catches your <span></span>. Or, you could save yourself a whole lot of <span></span> trouble and watch <span></span> TV instead!
