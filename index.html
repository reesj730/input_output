        When you fall in love, it is a temporary madness. It erupts like an earthquake, and then it subsides. You have a desire to expand your <span>horizons</span> and apply <span></span> to meaningful connections. Love is not breathlessness, it is not excitement. You will find yourself struggling to <span></span> in your <span></span> space. These frustrations will see their beginnings in <span></span> and <span></span> as connected to your <span></span> and <span></span>. An endless array of <span></span> and <span></span> will affect your journey to <span></span>. Exercise <span></span>, give things time, and the situation will <span></span> itself into  <span></span> of <span></span>. You don’t have to make up your mind right away, but perhaps with more <span></span> there will be a <span></span> in your life. Love itself is what is left over, when being in love has burned away. Remember, to be <span></span>, you must not get out of your <span></span> space or offer love’s <span></span> too <span></span>. For that is just being in love. 
      </p>

      <p id="fateText" class="hidden">
        Many <span></span> try to master fate, to make it conform to what they <span></span>. But, of course, fate doesn't work that way. By trying to <span></span> fate once, you put yourself in the position of having to <span></span> fate always. At every instant, you will struggle against those <span></span> of the pre-conceived <span></span> that don't favor your <span></span>. Ultimately, you may become so <span></span> with your fate that you seek <span></span> : you will be <span></span>, unable to see the half-truths behind the <span></span>. By trying to master fate, you may bring yourself to <span></span>. Fate is what you plan and <span></span> to do with your life, and the idea of <span></span> friendship. <span></span> is joined with fate. It may seem that we were fated to <span></span>, though it is difficult to say. Do not fret, for meeting your <span></span> is fate, and becoming part of your <span></span> is a choice. Falling in love with <span></span> however, is far beyond the cosmos, and will only bring you <span></span>.

      <p id="destinyText" class="hidden">
        It is <span></span>, for you may have longed to enter the world of <span></span>. Now you see it filled with<span></span>, with <span></span> and <span></span>, with those who would <span></span> all around them. Yet, enter it you must, for it is a destiny laid on each of us. True, you have seen these <span></span>. But there are equal parts of <span></span> and <span></span>. For each of us comes a time when we must be more than what we are. Is there not enough <span></span> in living the days given to us? You should know there is <span></span> in simply being among those we <span></span> and the things we <span></span>, and <span></span>, too. But, alas, in most of us good and bad are closely woven as the <span></span> on a <span></span>. Had you chosen to <span></span>, you would ever wonder whether your choice was made through <span></span> or following the wishes of your own <span></span>. You see this is as it must be, and the <span></span> laid upon you.
